		<p>My wife has often said if she had to do what I do she'd be tempted to poke her eyes out. I just love helping people. There's just something about simplifying the complex, enabling someone to do something that would otherwise be overwhelming.</p>
	    <p>And it's not an ego thing, but more </p>
		<p>Add to that the DITA (DIT-ah) standard thing that all the cool kids are into. Google "Darwin Information Typing Architecture" some night when you can't sleep and you'll be out in no time. If you're not familiar with DITA, it's conceptually like the MLA Style we had in college for writing our papers. The idea is to provide a structured environment for documents written by multiple authors to be happily married into a single publication.</p>
	    <p>Okay, back to Technical Writers. Just like we have doctors with differing specialties to help us with the extreme intricacies of our health, we need writers to explain the software, walk us through the "some assembly required" on Christmas Eve, or convince us why we need the latest and greatest widget (with chrome trim of course).</p>
	    <p>This is where I come in. God, in His infinite wisdom, has given me the desire and ability to translate the techno gorgon that confounds a great many of us into the English language. In fact, I enjoy it and love having the opportunity to put my skills, experience, and boyish charm to work on that writing project that no one in the office wants any part of.</p>
	    <p>Now, before you run to the college and sign up for a Tech Writing class, let me give you a little more information on the wonderful world I live in. Specifically, the 80/20 rule. I don't know if this applies to all forms of writing, but Technical Writing requires a tremendous amount of research. I also am not sure my proportions are true, but it sure seems like I spend more time looking things up, talking to people who know what I'm trying to learn (Subject Matter Experts), and checking my work to make sure I got it right than I do actually writing. Maybe 60/40.</p>
		<p>You know, they make software that writes Help. But software doesn't care if the end product is useful. That takes a person who is passionate about their work.</p>
