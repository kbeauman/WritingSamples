			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr />
			<div class="indent">
			<p>I was a Marketing Manager for a small consulting firm when my boss gave me the assignment to write a sales proposal, which I had never done but thoroughly enjoyed. When the project was complete, my boss informed me that I was "...a really good Technical Writer." I expressed my gratitude for the compliment and quickly launched an investigation into this Technical Writer thing. As it turns out, a person can actually make a living at it. And so I have.</p>
			<p>I walked into my first contract job as a Technical Writer in March of 2000 with virtually no experience or training. I soon discovered I had an aptitude for learning software programs well enough to write online help. Fortunately, I was able to teach myself HTML in time to deliver the project.</p>
			<p>Since then I've held both salary and contract positions with small, medium, and large organizations. As technology has grown, I've continuously developed my skills with the tools and coding languages I use in producing a variety of materials required by each of these organizations.</p>
			<p>In my downtime, well, I write. Children's stories, wiki articles, and (because I'm a gamer) walkthroughs are my favorites. I also play the guitar from time to time, and the occasional do-it-yourself home improvement project.</p>
