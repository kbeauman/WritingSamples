                                <h1>Glossary</h1>
                                <h2>Common Terms and Acronyms</h2>
                                <p><b>2FA (Two Factor Authentication)</b> - Rather than relying on a password alone, 2FA adds a second layer of security by requiring users to verify their identities using a second step to a login. Typical forms of 2FA are a security question with a preset answer, or texting a numeric token to the user's smartphone which they must type in to complete the login process.</p>
                                <p><b>3rd Party Cookie</b> - A cookie is a small script file placed on the hard drive of your computer by the server of a website that you visit. The purpose of the file is to recognize your specific information about your visit in the event that you were to return to the same site.  All cookies have an owner which tells who the cookie belongs to. The owner is the domain specified in the cookie, which is also the “party”.  If the owner of the cookie is not the same as the domain you are visiting, then it is a third party cookie.  ForeSee uses third party cookies, since we are the owner of the cookies but they are being used on our clients' website.</p>
                                <p><b>A/B Test</b> - A method of comparing two versions of something against each other to determine which one performs better, using data and statistics to validate the decision.  In the context of ForeSee, we have the ability to conduct A/B testing on our survey invitations to determine which variation will lead to higher acceptance rates, pending leadership approval. Additionally, clients may conduct A/B tests on different versions of product pages, home pages, etc. and use our data to validate which version promotes higher customer satisfaction.</p>
                                <p><b>ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index)</b> - A national cross-industry measure of customer satisfaction.  This index measures the satisfaction of U.S. household consumers with the quality of products and services offered by both foreign and domestic firms with significant share in U.S. markets. The ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Methodology was founded based on the ACSI.</p>
                                <p><a name="ANI"></a><b>ANI  (Automatic Number Identification)</b> - A service that provides the receiver of a telephone call with the number of the calling phone (e.g., Called ID).  In a call center, ANI displays the number of the calling party to the call center agent in real time. Among other things, the call center can use the information to forward calls to different people for different geographic areas. In ForeSee context, the client may pass the ANI along with the caller to the <a href="#IVR" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">IVR</a> Survey application to allow for additional fields (call date, time, Agent ID, etc.) to be appended to the data on the backend, matching on the ANI, through an integration process.</p>
                                <p><b>API (Application Programming Interface)</b> - Application-to-application “contracts”, where one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and publishes the API’s (i.e., the rules) that must be followed to access the services provided by the program.  ForeSee has a public API available that allows clients to pull data from our system, though we don’t allow clients to push data back via our API at this time.</p>
                                <p><b>Benchmarks</b> - A benchmark is a standardization that serves as a basis for evaluation or comparison.  In terms of ForeSee, benchmarks are the mean scores/values for whatever the client wants to compare, such as their <a href="#WOMI" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">WOMI</a> score, <a href="#NPS" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">NPS</a> score, or Satisfaction score to the industry average.</p>
                                <p><a name="BOPIS"></a><b>BOPIS (Buy Online, Pickup In Store)</b> - A type of retail fulfillment experience where the consumer initiates and completes the purchase of a product online, but instead of having the product shipped to their residence, they pick the product up within a physical store after a specified period of time.  The store may either have the product in-stock already or may need to have the product shipped to that specific store from another store or a warehouse.</p>
                                <p><b>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</b> - A system of distributed servers (network) that deliver web pages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.  All ForeSee client code is hosted on a CDN (Fastly or AWS).</p>
                                <p><b>Click ‘n’ Collect</b> - This is the term commonly used in the United Kingdom to describe a Reserve/Buy Online Pick-up in Store (<a href="#ROPIS" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">ROPIS</a>/<a href="#BOPIS" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">BOPIS</a>) experience.</p>
                                <p><b>Codify</b> - The process of taking a list of responses (e.g., Product Names, Age, etc.) and categorizing them into a more refined set to allow for segmentation via filtering. Each category (Product A, Product B, etc.) is assigned a code (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) to allow a programmatic way to segment the data.</p>
                                <p><a name="CPP"></a><b>CPP (Customer Passed Parameter)</b> - A Customer Passed Parameter is a data point created by, or currently available from, the survey respondent that is captured at the time of survey submission (in contrast to an <a href="#EPP" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">EPP</a>, which appends the data after submission).  CPPs can typically be captured via a variable, cookie, or URL string accessible while ForeSee code is running. Common CPPs include the browser, device, and operating system the respondent used to view the web site. Using CPPs or EPPs is dependent on the type of deployment and how the client's system can efficiently pass the data to ForeSee. See <a href="../cxMeasurement/store.htm#COMMON" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Store Measure</a> for examples of both CPPs and EPPs.</p>
                                <p><a name="CQs"></a><b>CQ (Custom Question)</b> - These are the diagnostic questions included in surveys that allow for deeper segmentation of the ForeSee performance metrics (i.e., Model Results). Clients typically have more flexibility in designing and modifying the Custom Questions during the contract term. Custom Questions are not used in calculating scores, satisfaction, or impacts.</p>
                                <p><b>CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</b> - At its simplest, a CRM system allows businesses to manage business relationships and the data associated with the relationship. With CRM, you can store customer and prospect contact information, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities in one central location (ideally in the cloud so the information is accessible by many) in real time. A key example of a CRM is Salesforce. In ForeSee context, many clients request the ability to integrate ForeSee into their CRM or their CRM data into Foresee.</p>
                                <p><a name="CRM"></a><b>CRM (Customer Relationship Measure)</b> - A single, dedicated measurement of the target audience’s satisfaction with the overall relationship with the company cumulative of all interactions.  It is NOT measuring satisfaction with a specific channel, in-channel experience, or brand affinity/awareness.</p>
                                <p><span class="wintitle">CSAT</span> - Customer Satisfaction.</p>
                                <p><a name="CSS"></a><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> - A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.  It is one of the three languages, along with <a href="#HTML" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">HTML</a> and <a href="#JS" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">JS</a>, from which our trigger code is built.</p>
                                <p><span class="wintitle">CSV (Comma Separated Values)</span> - A standard file format used to store and transfer data. CSV files are commonly used within <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span> for uploading <a href="hierarchyAbout.htm" title="Click to view this Help &amp;amp; Training Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Help &amp;amp; Training Guide topic.">Hierarchies</a> and <a href="taSettings.htm" title="Click to view this Help &amp;amp; Training Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Help &amp;amp; Training Guide topic.">Custom Data Feeds</a>.</p>
                                <p><b>Customer Effort Score</b> – A metric utilized by organizations to measure the actual level of effort a customer has put into resolving their needs against their level of expected effort it should have taken. Typically, this is measured through the use of a rating question.</p>
                                <p><b>Domain</b> - When most people think of a website domain, they are actually thinking of what is called the mid-level domain.  For the website foresee.com, ".com" is the top level domain while "foresee" is the mid-level domain.  Another example would be target.com where the “target” part of the domain is the mid-level domain.  A domain name is commonly part of a larger internet address called a <a href="#URL" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">URL</a>. A URL goes into much more detail than domain name, providing much more information, including the specific page address, folder name, machine name, and protocol language. </p>
                                <p style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../Resources/Images/URLbreakdown.png" title="Parts of a URL" alt="Parts of a URL" />

                                <p><b>Dynamic Routing/Cloud Based Routing</b> – Dynamic Call Routing is the process of automatically re-routing a call based on specific criteria change (such as time of day or as the network traffic levels of congestion).</p>
                                <p><b>Dynamic Text</b> - Dynamic text is verbiage that changes based on some predetermined criteria. When you insert a piece of dynamic text, it automatically displays the current value of its respective property. When that property is updated, the dynamic text automatically updates. Dynamic text works through the use of syntax tags in the HTML code. This allows the combination of both dynamic and static text in a single text element and applies the available formatting options to customize the resulting text display. In ForeSee context, dynamic text is utilized when personalizing email invitations with the respondents First/Last name, or inserting a brand name into the survey for panel studies or enterprise configurations. There are limitations in which this capability can be deployed and whether it requires additional investment.</p>
                                <p><b>Elements</b> - This is the left side of the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Model and are the key components of the experience we measure that have an impact on satisfaction.

                                <p><b>InSession</b> - InSession refers to when the visitor takes the survey after receiving and accepting the invitation.  With InSession, the survey displays immediately after accepting the invitation, instead of after the visitor has met an exit condition (e.g., travelled to a new domain, closed the browser, or moved to a page without our code present).  Both desktop and mobile surveys can be InSession, though this is not considered best practice for desktop.</p>
                                <p><b>IVA (Intelligent Voice Automation)</b> - A system that uses voice instead of touch-tone to capture data.  IVA is one of the ways ForeSee implements phone surveys.  With IVA, the survey questions are computer recorded and the respondent answers questions verbally instead of by touch pad. Currently, ForeSee does not allow for verbal responses to the surveys, but can allow for the use of computer generated voice prompts (as opposed to human voice recordings).</p>
                                <p><b>IS (Implementation Services)</b> - The department within ForeSee that provides implementation and technical support both internally and externally.</p>

Once the LF threshold has been met, the visitor is then qualified to fall within the Sampling Percentage criteria. The Loyalty Factor only increments for active tabs.  If a visitor has two tabs open for the same website in the same browser window, the tabs do not aggregate the number of page views to reach the LF. One page will reach it before the other.</p>
                                <p><b>Live Date (Panel Study)</b> - The full launch of the survey by the panel company.  Follows the <a href="#softlaunch" title="Click to view this Glossary term." alt="Click to view this Glossary term." class="selected">Soft Launch</a>.</p>

NPS is widely used across many organizations because it provides a single metric that the C-Suite can track. ForeSee has historically recommended against companies using NPS as the single metric for tracking customer experience success, as it is an outcome of improving Satisfaction. Whereas the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Methodology provides predictive analytics allowing the client to prioritize improvement efforts that drive up Satisfaction, thus impacting Future Behaviors, such as Likelihood to Recommend.</p>
                                <p><b>OAMOE (Online Alternate Method of Entry)</b> - Clients can offer sweepstakes as an incentive to visitors for taking Store Measure surveys.  By law, an alternate method of entry without having to purchase is required.  We can create an OAMOE page to be shown after the survey has been completed. </p>
                                <p><b>OnExit</b> - OnExit refers to when the visitor takes the survey after receiving and accepting the invitation.  Instead of the survey displaying immediately after the visitor accepts the invitation, there is a tracker window that tracks the website session. As soon as the visitor ends their session, either by closing the tab/window or leaving the domain, the survey presents within the tracker window.</p>
                                <p><b>Over Quota (Panel Study)</b> - The number of completed responses over the contractually required amount.  ForeSee is charged an additional fee for each over-quota response. </p>
