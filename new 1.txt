High Quality Screen Shots for Word Documents

 

Word documents generally have a seven inch width for text and images. To perform a screen shot with the highest possible resolution, use the following procedure:

 

1. Open the page to be captured in a separate browser window.

2. In restore mode, adjust the browser window width to seven inches. You can have your Word document open in the background to use as a guide.

3. Zoom out until the screen appears as desired. Do this by holding the Ctrl key down and scrolling back on your mouse wheel. Generally, 50% for full screen and 65% for dialog boxes is ideal.

4. Take the screen shot and, unless other shots are needed, hold the Ctrl key down and press the zero key to restore the browser back to 100%.
